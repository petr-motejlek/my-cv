## What I&nbsp;Am Offering {#offering}

</div>

- __15+ years of experience__ spanning software development for a plethora
  of platforms, network administration and maintenance, full stack web
  and application development, single machine setups as well as clusters. I also have
  experience talking to customers, and am able to proficiently understand
  their problems and propose appropriate solutions.  
- Very __quick learner__, preferring __diving deep__, rather than
  superficial understanding.
- Knowledge about __multiple different programming languages and paradigms__
  (currently, my favorites are __TypeScript__ (both NodeJS and browser), __OOP__, __TDD__ and __DDD__
  with a sprinkle of __functional programming__).
- I __truly enjoy this field__, and always do my best to get better at it.
- Live in Prague, Czech Republic.

## What Next Challenge I&nbsp;Am Looking For {#next-challenge}

</div>

- Develop a product through which we can make a __direct impact on our
  customers__ and their users.
- Could involve infrastructure as well, either as the platform for
  delivering/running the product, or be the product by itself.
- Move more into __functional programming with persistent data structures__
  (__Elm__, __Rust__, __Clojure__ or its derivatives, perhaps; but most
  languages do somehow support this paradigm too).
- Would prefer (probably always will) a __collocated team__, but will
  experiment with remote too.
- The job could involve consultancy (partially or fully) work too.
- I prefer __full-time employment__ to contract work.

## I&nbsp;Enjoy Doing, Know About and Am Highly Motivated By {#enjoy-doing}

</div>

- __Agile__, __open__, __transparent__ and __trusting__ environment where
  teams are __empowered__ to come up with solutions to problems __on their
  own__. No long-winded requirement specification or design documents written
  by "somebody else" for the teams to "implement without thinking".
- __Automation and clouds__, with __continuous integration__ and __deployment__
  - I want us to deploy our software ourselves (__DevOps is a must__).
- __TypeScript__, __Kubernetes__, __Docker__, __Python__, __Ansible__,
  __IntelliJ IDEA__, __VS Code__, __Scrum__, __AWS__, __Azure__, __Git__,
  etc.
- __Iterative development__ with __short release cycles__.
- __Typing the code__ (hence TypeScript).
- __Clean code__, __clean architecture__.
- Prefer __software over hardware__.
- Prefer working on/with web and media technologies, or related.
- __Transparency__ and __openness__.
- __Sharing__ what I know with others (verbally, through lectures, by
  compiling [knowledge bases](https://bit.ly/my-knowledge-base)).
- __Learning__ more and more.
- __Working as a team__, rather than an individual or a group of individuals.
  - Pair and/or mob programming.
- Drive for __continuously inspecting and adapting__ on all levels of the
  organization.
- __Flat organization__ with high-performing teams organized around projects
  with full support, responsibility and accountability.
- I prefer __face to face conversations__, however understand that right now,
  that's not really possible.
- Experience with __leading teams__ (empowering them to work better and better,
  while developing team members), some experience with being a Product Owner
  and Scrum Master, however prefer being a highly engaged member of a development
  team.
- Like to travel.

## I&nbsp;Dislike and Get Demotivated By {#dislike}

</div>

- Complex organizational ladders, politics and hierarchy.
- Thinking of people as ourcesÎ®d thinking they can deliver the best output when
  working on more than one project.
- Repetitive manual tasks and outgrown historical systems.
- Incremental (waterfall) development with long release cycles.
- Waste, both physical (unnecessary paper overuse), as well as process.

## Professional History {#professional-history}
