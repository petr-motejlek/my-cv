## What I&nbsp;Am Offering {#offering}

</div>

- __15+ years of experience__ spanning software development for a plethora
  of platforms, network administration and maintenance, full stack web
  and application development, single machine setups as well as clusters and clouds.
  I also have experience talking to customers, and am able to proficiently understand
  their problems and propose appropriate solutions.  
- Very __quick learner__, preferring __diving deep__, rather than
  superficial understanding.
- Knowledge about __multiple different programming languages and paradigms__
  (currently, my favorites are __TypeScript__ (both NodeJS and browser), __OOP__, __TDD__ and __DDD__
  with a sprinkle of __functional programming__), as well as __automated operationalization__,
  __deployment__, __monitoring__ and __backup__ solutions and strategies, both __on-prem__ and __in-cloud__.
- I __truly enjoy this field__, and always do my best to get better at it.
- Live in Prague, Czech Republic.

## What Next Challenge I&nbsp;Am Looking For {#next-challenge}

</div>

- __Move into__ an __infrastructure/operationalization role__, rather
  than focus on pure development. I have always enjoyed operationalizing
  the software I write, and have done so on all my side projects. As
  an _institutionalized developer_, though, I do not get to do this as much,
  as the infrastrucutre is usually laid out before us, and we can only
  really use it, or add small extensions to it. I'd like to be part
  of creating the infrastructure and making sure it works well for
  all its users.
- Can work in an __on-prem__ setting, __in-cloud__ setting or any hybrid, 
  if need be. Migrations in between are always interesting.
- I prefer __infrastructure as code__ and am profficient in several
  tools and practices (_Terraform_ and _Ansible_ are my favorite)
  with good DevOps support (such as service mesh architecture for
  microservices).
- I prefer a __remote-first work__ (home-office) mode, with the ability
  to go to the ofice in person, as needed.
- The job could involve consultancy (partially or fully) work too.

## I&nbsp;Enjoy Doing, Know About and Am Highly Motivated By {#enjoy-doing}

</div>

- __Agile__, __open__, __transparent__ and __trusting__ environment where
  teams are __empowered__ to come up with solutions to problems __on their
  own__. No long-winded requirement specification or design documents written
  by "somebody else" for the teams to "implement without thinking".
- __Automation and clouds__, with __continuous integration__ and __deployment__
  - I want us to deploy our software ourselves (__DevOps is a must__).
- __TypeScript__, __Kubernetes__, __Docker__, __Python__, __Ansible__,
  __IntelliJ IDEA__, __VS Code__, __Scrum__, __AWS__, __Azure__, __Git__,
  etc.
- __Iterative development__ with __short release cycles__.
- __Typing the code__ (hence TypeScript).
- __Clean code__, __clean architecture__.
- Prefer __software over hardware__.
- Prefer working on/with web and media technologies, or related.
- __Transparency__ and __openness__.
- __Sharing__ what I know with others (verbally, through lectures, by
  compiling [knowledge bases](https://bit.ly/my-knowledge-base)).
- __Learning__ more and more.
- Drive for __continuously inspecting and adapting__ on all levels of the
  organization.
- __Flat organization__ with high-performing teams organized around projects
  with full support, responsibility and accountability.
- Experience with __leading teams__ (empowering them to work better and better,
  while developing team members), some experience with being a Product Owner
  and Scrum Master, however prefer being a highly engaged member of a development
  team.
- Like to travel.

## I&nbsp;Dislike and Get Demotivated By {#dislike}

</div>

- Complex organizational ladders, politics and hierarchy.
- Thinking of people as ourcesÎ®d thinking they can deliver the best output when
  working on more than one project.
- Repetitive manual tasks and outgrown historical systems.
- Incremental (waterfall) development with long release cycles.
- Waste, both physical (unnecessary paper overuse), as well as process.

## Professional History {#professional-history}
